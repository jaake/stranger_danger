StrangerDanger
===============

A weird way to meet people and play location based games. It's basically urban geocaching with photos. 

The primary objective is fun. I encourage people to use it for events, games, and anything else you can think of.

I have built this application in order to explore fun ways to use GPS coords on mobile devices in Nashville. 
Currently this application is running in development mode and is for testing purposes only.
Stranger Danger will be launched in a public Beta only for Nashvillians by January 2015. 

If you would like to work on this project please email me at jaake@jklm.io
