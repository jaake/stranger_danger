StrangerDanger
===============

A weird way to meet people and play location based games. 

The primary objective is fun. I encourage people to use it for events, games, and anything else you can think of.

Currently this application is running in development mode and is for testing purposes only.
Stranger Danger will be launched in a public Beta only for Nashvillians by January 2015.
